#  Solar Panel Condition Classification and Power Generation Prediction


 Solar energy will surpass all other renewable
energy sources in efficiency, becoming the dominant source of
power when non-renewable resources run out. Detecting the
impacts of external conditions on a solar panel at various
periods is one of the objectives of the study, which also aims to
predict the quantity of electricity generated. In this study, a
number of convolutional neural network (CNN) models were
trained and assessed on datasets of solar panels for
categorizing panel condition (Dust, Clean, Waterdrop, and
Shadow), and RandomForestRegressor for the power dataset.
The proposed model exhibits higher training and validation
accuracy as well as overall superior performance in training
for our solar panel dataset. When compared to the test sets,
PVConv's accuracy is 93.75% with a training accuracy of
99.33%. A calculation of the power produced by 21 solar
panels revealed that power production is lower in the morning
and afternoon than it is at noon and shadows generate less
power than dust and clean panels. The suggested model using
the RandomForestRegressor demonstrated potential for
classifying images of solar panels and calculating electrical
generation.
